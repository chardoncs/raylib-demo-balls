# Balls - A simple raylib demo

I wrote this simple program when I was learning raylib.
It has no name, I just call it "balls" (pun unintended).

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is running `make`

```bash
make run
```

## Build

It is recommended to use Clang or GCC. MSVC compatibility is **not** guaranteed.
